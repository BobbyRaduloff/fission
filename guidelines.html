                <h1 class="display-5"> Experiment </h1>
                <p class="lead">
                    An experiment is a research of a question in an attempt to prove an arguable answer of it (a
                    hypothesis). All experiments should have a clearly stated question and an arguable hypothesis (do
                    not try to prove a fact). The question guiding the investigation should be relevant to modern
                    scientific or industrial issues. All participants must have a Lab Report at the fair. It should
                    include the following sections:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Abstract (100-200 word summary)</li>

                <p class="lead">
                    All authors of experiments must bring a report at the fair. The Lab Report CAN be incorporated in
                    the poster. It is not mandatory for the presentation to follow the report exactly, but we recommend
                    communicating the most important points. You can also have a separate copy of the report in the form
                    of a booklet. In the presentation, you need to summarize your research question and hypothesis, the
                    procedure you used for the investigation, the data you collected, the results of your research and
                    the conclusions that you reached. You may also mention noteworthy information about the references
                    you consulted, your materials, modifications you made or challenges you experienced. You may also
                    emphasise the importance of your investigation and point out what studies you think should follow
                    this experiment. You can find more information about what each part should include <a

                <h1 class="display-5">Working Model</h1>
                <p class="lead">
                    A working model is a portable construction of a mechanism or an invention that does certain work.
                    This project type may include robots, machines, electronic devices, computer programs, etc. The
                    invention MUST do some work and have some application. In the presentation, participants need to
                    summarize the background research, the device they are demonstrating, and its wider purpose.
                    <br>
                    Incorporate all the capabilities of your model into your presentation. Also discuss the process of
                    construction, the materials, modifications made, challenges experienced, or things you would do
                    different if you were to do this project again. Models are displayed on the project tables alongside
                    your posters. If there are any circumstances which hinder the live demonstration of your project,
                    you must provide a video of the working model and a thorough explanation. The video should be with
                    you at the fair on a flash drive.
                </p>
                <h1 class="display-5">Requirements</h1>
                <p class="lead">At Fission, all participants MUST:</p>

                        on the bottom. Lettering should be clear and large enough to be seen from a distance.
                        Charts, graphs, photos, and drawings should be labelled. Include the names of all group
                        members and the group's number (given upon registration). Additional requirements are
                        mentioned below each project type.</li>

                    All projects must compete in one category only. Students with projects from intermediate disciplines
                    (Bioinformatics, Biophysics, Neuroscience, Palaeontology), as well projects using methods, or ideas
                    from many areas must choose the category they think their project fits best in.
